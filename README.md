# trek-loader-testing
experimental serial basic source code loader for patb on tang nano 9k(sbc8080)
how to use:<BR>
<PRE>
on Windows11 cmd.exe, you type bellow.
type trektake.asc|ppython com5.py
Then wait for ending upload trektake.asc.
exit cmd.exe(press x button, or ctrl-c), then connect tang nano 9k with serial (teraterm).
Then you should type in Enter key, you would see OK on teraterm.
Then type RUN on teraterm.
But unfortunately you would see ocasionally error cause on basic.
Perhaps it is shortage of wait time or anything else.
</PRE>
Enjoy! 9600baud serial communication!
